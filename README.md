# SVG LOGO GENERATOR

## Description 
Much like a monogram I wanted to created an application that created a simple 3-letter logo.

## Installation 
Just open the integrated terminal and start 'node index.js' and the CLI will prompt you through some questions to build your logo!

## Usage
You can see the SVG logo you created populate by dragging the new file to the browser!
